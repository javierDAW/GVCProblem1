Install dependencies in debian

sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install apache_log_parser 

Running the main.py file, the parser starts to compare the lines of the security_log (apache log) against some rules (more rules need to be created)
if any of them matches it records the line into the file malicious.log.
lastIndex file needs to be in 0 the first time.
addLines.py is used to deploy the script (Not Apache with real attacks at home)

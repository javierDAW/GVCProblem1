In this version of CRS 3 we have renumbered the rules to be more logical and helpful. As part of this we are providing idNumbering.csv and update.py (locating in the id_numbering folder). 
This file lists the old rule IDs with the new rule ID in case you want to update your exceptions or check for conflicts. 
We appreciate your understanding in this matter. 
This README and associated idNumbering.csv will be removed when this branch is promoted to master.

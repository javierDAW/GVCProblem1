In this version of CRS 3 we have renumbered the rules to be more logical and helpful.

The filenames of the rule files correspond with the IDs of rules in the file.
First rule of a given file is usually 9XX100, then the rules continue in steps
of ten. Related rules / siblings follow with a single digit id (9XX101, etc.).

As part of this we are providing idNumbering.csv and update.py (locating in the
id_numbering folder).  This file lists the old rule IDs of the 2.2.X release
with the new rule ID of the 3.0.X release in case you want to update your
exceptions or check for conflicts. It is a comma separated list. Rule which
have been removed are listed with the new ID 000000 in the CSV file.  This
means that the former rule is no longer part of CRS 3.

A rule renumbering is painful for all existing installations. But we really
think that the rule IDs lacked sense and reason and we are confident future
maintenance will be much easier once this is done. We appreciate your
understanding in this matter.
